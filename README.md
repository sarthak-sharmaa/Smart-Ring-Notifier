# Smart-Ring-Notifier
The Smart Ring Notifier detects when a landline telephone with an LCD display is ringing and sends an email notification with an image attachment. It uses OpenCV for image processing, customtkinter for the GUI, and the Gmail API for email notifications. Selenium automates the retrieval of a new OAuth2 refresh token if the existing one expires.
